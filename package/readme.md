# Moorexa packagers
This folder contains a list of packagers. Packagers are disk images for our application. They put things together to make up the framework.

Just think of packagers as to the brain box of a car. Developers are allowed to build around this concept, share, and innovate.

The default disk image for the framework is ```Lightroom\Packager\Moorexa```. You can create yours or require one via composer.

To use this repo, ensure you have [https://github.com/moorexa/micro] or [https://github.com/moorexa/default] pulled 
to your machine, download this repo and merge with the root ```package/``` directory.
